"Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus is known as chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C is usually a ""silent"" infection for many years, until the virus damages the liver enough to cause the signs and symptoms of liver disease. Signs and symptoms include:  Bleeding easily Bruising easily Fatigue Poor appetite Yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice) Dark-colored urine Itchy skin Fluid buildup in your abdomen (ascites) Swelling in your legs Weight loss Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech (hepatic encephalopathy) Spiderlike blood vessels on your skin (spider angiomas)  Every chronic hepatitis C infection starts with an acute phase. Acute hepatitis C usually goes undiagnosed because it rarely causes symptoms. When signs and symptoms are present, they may include jaundice, along with fatigue, nausea, fever and muscle aches.

The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years. At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may think they are just part of getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. Hypothyroidism symptoms may include:  Tiredness. More sensitivity to cold. Constipation. Dry skin. Weight gain. Puffy face. Hoarse voice. Coarse hair and skin. Muscle weakness. Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness. Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular. Thinning hair. Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia. Depression. Memory problems.  Hypothyroidism in infants Anyone can get hypothyroidism, including infants. Most babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work correctly don't have symptoms right away. But if hypothyroidism isn't diagnosed and treated, symptoms start to appear. They may include:  Feeding problems. Poor growth. Poor weight gain. Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, a condition called jaundice. Constipation. Poor muscle tone. Dry skin. Hoarse crying. Enlarged tongue. A soft swelling or bulge near the belly button, a condition called umbilical hernia.  When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental development problems.

Common signs and symptoms of psoriasis include:  A patchy rash that varies widely in how it looks from person to person, ranging from spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions over much of the body Rashes that vary in color, tending to be shades of purple with gray scale on brown or Black skin and pink or red with silver scale on white skin Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children) Dry, cracked skin that may bleed Itching, burning or soreness Cyclic rashes that flare for a few weeks or months and then subside  There are several types of psoriasis, each of which varies in its signs and symptoms:  Plaque psoriasis. The most common type of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis causes dry, itchy, raised skin patches (plaques) covered with scales. There may be few or many. They usually appear on the elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. The patches vary in color, depending on skin color. The affected skin might heal with temporary changes in color (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation), particularly on brown or Black skin. Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe disease may cause the nail to crumble. Guttate psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling spots on the trunk, arms or legs. Inverse psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. It causes smooth patches of inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis, a rare type, causes clearly defined pus-filled blisters. It can occur in widespread patches or on small areas of the palms or soles. Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. It can be short-lived (acute) or long-term (chronic).",Psoriasis,"plaque psoriasis plaque psoriasis plaque psoriasis plaque psoriasis common type psoriasis cause dry raise skin patch plaque cover
